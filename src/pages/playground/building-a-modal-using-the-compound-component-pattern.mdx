## Introduction

Compound components is a react pattern which uses more than one component together in such a way that they can share states explicitly with each other. 

I learnt the compound component technique from Kent C Dodds from his **Epic React** course which I highly recommend. 

A basic example of a some-what compound component is the `<select></select>` button and it's corresponding child `<option></option>`

    N.B: This is an advanced React pattern and would require a comfortable knowledge of React and React hooks.

Our Final modal Component would look like this 

```jsx
<Modal>
	<ModalButton>Click Me!</ModalButton>
	<ModalContents>
		<p>I am a content inside a Modal hooray!</p>
	</ModalContents>	
</Modal>
```

Typically one component is the parent as `<Modal>` was in the above code sample, and the other is the child. The main objective is to distribute and manage a more expressive and flexible API to it's children component.

We are going to be using the Context API to manage state compared to cloning the components and updating them and rendering them back again. Personally, I find the context API approach neater and easier to understand and manage. 

### First Step
Create the modal file and the modal context. 

```jsx
import  React  from  "react";
const  ModalContext  =  React.createContext(null);

const Modal = (props) => {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false);
  const value = [isOpen, setIsOpen];

  return <ModalContext.Provider value={value} {...props} />;
};
```

This is the parent component that has the power to share the state of the modal to its child component. 

We created the `[isOpen, setIsOpen]` state and we will share it to the child components soon but before that, we should create our `useModal` hook so we can easily use the context i other files without bothering ourself with something like `React.useContext("the context created some files away")`

```jsx
function useModal() {
  const context = React.useContext(ModalContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error(`useModal must be used in or within a Modal Component`);
  }
  return context;
}
```

Now we can just call the `useModal` hook and it will provide us with the states in the context or a useful error message should we err.

Now, we will create the child components. We will start with the ModalButton component. 

```jsx
const ModalButton = ({ children: child }) => {
  const [, setIsOpen] = useModal();

  return React.cloneElement(child, {
    onClick: () => setIsOpen(true)
  });
};
```

Notice the React.cloneElement we used in the above code. We are giving the child element of the `ModalButton` component the `onClick` functionality because we don't want the `ModalButton` to be an actual component itself but a component wrapper that can wrap either a button, icon and any component of your choice which becomes its child in this scenario.

The next component is the `ModalContents` which will hold the dimiss button and the content of the modal. 

```jsx
const ModalContents = ({ children }) => {
const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useModal();

  function closeModal() {
    setIsOpen(false);
  }
  
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        padding: "15px",
        boxShadow: "3px 3px 5px 6px #ccc",
        borderRadius: "10px",
        position: "fixed",
        top: "50%",
        left: "50%",
        transform: "translate(-50%, -50%)",
        display: `${isOpen ? "block" : "none"}`
      }}
    >
      <button onClick={closeModal}>
        X
      </button>
      <div className="modal-content">{children}</div>
    </div>
  );
};

export { Modal, ModalButton, ModalContents };
```
The Modal Component will simply return the children passed into it and there is also a modal dismiss button which also changes the state of the modal.
